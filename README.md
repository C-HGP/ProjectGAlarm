# ProjectGAlarm

This is my first-year entrylevel project.

A alarm system with basic functions such as:
-Turn the alarm on and off (ofcourse)
-Logging
-SOS code
-Sensor triggers
-Siren modes
-Keypad setup
-Modes such as shell-alarm/full-alarm

I hope you'll find this project interesting as this is my first big project during my class.
This will be updated now and then
