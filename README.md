# ProjectGAlarm

This is my first-year entrylevel project.
I've made this over the time of 5 days as assignment with my friend.
This was a fun experience. I hope you can find use of this simple project. I will continue to develop this
as time goes on.
This is however a working product, so I won't be adding anything in the near future.

I plan to however to get some actual motionsensors and doormagnets working with this.


A alarm system with basic functions such as:           
* Turn the alarm on and off (ofcourse)
* Logging
* SOS code
* Sensor triggers
* Siren modes
* Keypad setup
* Modes such as shell-alarm/full-alarm

# How to setup #

To setup this system with the exact same Arduino build I have you need to:
 Markup : *Enter HCentral.cpp.
* Change the COM port to on line 19.
 (You can find this port by for example looking in the Arduino editor)
* Use the given MAKE-file.
* Run the program AlarmCentral.exe (This will run on LINUX aswell with the .exe extension)
